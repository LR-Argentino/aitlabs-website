## What are AI Automations?
AI Automations combine **artificial intelligence** with **process automation**. While traditional automations only follow rigid rules, AI Automations can:

- **Understand data** (text, speech, images)
- **Make decisions** (if-then-else + machine learning)
- **Consider context** (customer history, data, processes)
- **Learn & improve** (through training and feedback)

The result: Processes run not only automatically but also **intelligently and flexibly**.

## How Does It Work?
AI Automations are built on three layers:

1. **Input Understanding:** AI analyzes text, emails, documents, speech, or database entries.
2. **Decision Logic:** Based on AI models, RAG systems, or predefined rules, the system decides which action to take.
3. **Execution:** Integration with existing systems (CRM, ERP, HR, Finance, Email, Slack, Teams, etc.) executes the tasks.

Example:  
‚ÄúA customer writes an email asking for a callback.‚Äù  
‚Üí The AI detects the intent ‚Üí creates a calendar entry ‚Üí sends a confirmation ‚Üí notifies the responsible employee.
